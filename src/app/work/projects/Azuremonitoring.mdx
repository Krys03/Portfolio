# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Monitoring Dashboard & Alerting

## üéØ Objective  
The goal of this project was to build a **centralized monitoring system** on Azure for a web application.  
The system had to:  
- Track performance (CPU, memory, request latency).  
- Detect failed requests and security anomalies.  
- Trigger alerts automatically when issues occur.  

---

## üõ† Solution  

- Configured **Azure Monitor** to collect metrics and logs from the application.  
- Built queries with **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** in **Log Analytics** to detect anomalies.  
- Created a **custom dashboard** for performance KPIs (CPU, error rates, latency).  
- Integrated with **Azure Logic Apps** to trigger notifications (email + Teams) when thresholds were exceeded.  
- Infrastructure was reproducible thanks to **Terraform (IaC)**.

## üöÄ Result  

- Reduced **incident troubleshooting time** by 40%.  
- Real-time detection of failed requests.  
- Proactive alerts improved **system reliability** and SLA compliance.
