# ðŸ”’ Secure REST API with Spring Boot and React

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create a **secure user management platform** allowing administrators and standard users to authenticate, manage data, and access protected resources through JWT-based authentication.

## ðŸ›  Solution
- Built a **Spring Boot REST API** connected to **PostgreSQL**.
- Implemented **JWT authentication** for secure session handling.
- Added **role-based access control** (Admin/User) to restrict endpoints.
- Created a **React frontend** for login, registration, and CRUD.
- Containerized with **Docker Compose** for reproducibility.

## ðŸš€ Result
- Delivered a **fully functional & secure** web app.
- Ensured **controlled access** and **data protection** via JWT.
- Demonstrated **end-to-end Full Stack integration**.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Spring Boot (Java), PostgreSQL, React, JWT, Docker Compose
