# ☁️ Deploying a Scalable Web App on Azure App Service

##  Objective
Deploy a **Java Spring Boot + React web application** to **Azure App Service**, integrating continuous deployment from GitHub and observability via **Application Insights**.  
The goal was to automate deployments, ensure scalability, and maintain real-time visibility into app performance.

---

##  Solution
- **Configured Azure App Service** to host the application with an integrated CI/CD pipeline connected to GitHub.  
- Used **Docker** to containerize both backend and frontend.  
- Set up **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment to Azure.  
- Linked an **Azure SQL Database** for persistent data storage.  
- Activated **Application Insights** to collect telemetry and performance metrics.  

---

##  Implementation Steps
1. **Build & Containerize** the application using Spring Boot, React, and Docker.  
2. **Push the image** to Azure Container Registry.  
3. **Configure GitHub Actions** to deploy automatically on commit to the main branch.  
4. **Connect Azure SQL** and manage environment variables for database credentials.  
5. **Enable Application Insights** to monitor live usage, errors, and latency.  

---

##  Result
- A fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** through GitHub Actions.  
- Scalable and secure hosting on **Azure App Service**.  
- Centralized monitoring with **Application Insights**.  
- Demonstrated full DevOps workflow from build → deploy → observe.  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Azure App Service**  
- **Azure SQL Database**  
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**  
- **Docker**  
- **Spring Boot / React**  
- **Application Insights**
