# ðŸ”Ž Troubleshooting with Azure Monitor: How to Use Logs to Solve Problems

One of the biggest challenges in the cloud is **troubleshooting**. When something goes wrong â€” an app crashes, a database slows down, or a network fails â€” you need the right tools to find the cause quickly. On Azure, the key to problem-solving is **Azure Monitor and Log Analytics**.

## ðŸ“Š What is Azure Monitor?

Azure Monitor collects and analyzes **telemetry data** from all your cloud resources:  
- Performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk).  
- Application logs.  
- Security events.  
- Network diagnostics.  

Think of it as the **black box recorder** of your cloud environment.

## ðŸ—‚ Types of Logs You Can Use

Azure Monitor generates different logs:  

- **Activity Logs** â†’ high-level operations (who created a VM, who deleted a resource).  
- **Diagnostic Logs** â†’ detailed info about services (SQL queries, failed requests).  
- **Metrics** â†’ performance counters like CPU %, request latency, or throughput.  
- **Application Insights** â†’ app-level telemetry (exceptions, dependencies).

## ðŸ›  How to Troubleshoot Step by Step

### 1. Detect the Problem  
Use **Metrics Explorer** to see anomalies (e.g., CPU suddenly at 90%).  

### 2. Drill into Logs  
Go to **Log Analytics** and run KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries:  

```sql
AppRequests
| where success == false
| summarize count() by resultCode
```

ðŸ‘‰ This query shows failed HTTP requests and their error codes.  

### 3. Correlate Events  
Once you identify unusual activity, check the **Activity Logs** to see if a **deployment, update, or configuration change** happened around the same time.  
This correlation helps you understand **whether the issue is caused by code, infrastructure, or user action**.  

Example: a spike in errors right after a new release = likely a bad deployment.  

### 4. Alert and Automate  
Create **alerts** so Azure notifies you when thresholds are reached (e.g., response time > 2s).  
You can even connect alerts to **Logic Apps** or **Azure Functions** to trigger automatic remediation.

## âš¡ Example: Slow Web App  

- **Problem**: A web app is loading slowly.  
- **Investigation**:  
  1. Metrics show high CPU usage.  
  2. Log Analytics reveals a specific SQL query timing out.  
  3. Activity Logs confirm a recent deployment introduced inefficient queries.  
- **Solution**: Optimize the query + scale the database.

## âœ… Conclusion

Troubleshooting in Azure is all about **logs + metrics + context**.  
With Azure Monitor and Log Analytics, you can:  
- Detect issues in real time.  
- Correlate root causes with recent changes.  
- Automate alerts and even self-healing actions.  

ðŸ‘‰ Next step: explore how to integrate **Azure Monitor with Grafana or Power BI** for even deeper insights.
