# 🚀 Getting Started with Microsoft Azure: First Steps for Developers

Cloud computing has become a must-have skill for every developer, and Microsoft Azure is one of the leading platforms in the industry. If you’re new to Azure, don’t worry — this guide will walk you through your **first steps** so you can start building quickly and confidently.

## 🌩 1. Create Your Free Azure Account

- Go to [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).  
- Click **Start free**.  
- Microsoft gives you **$200 free credits** for the first 30 days + some always-free services.  

✅ Tip: Use a personal email first, then link your GitHub or company account later.  

---

## ⚙️ 2. Explore the Azure Portal

Once logged in, you’ll see the **Azure Portal**. Think of it as your Cloud control panel.  
From here you can:  
- Create new resources (servers, databases, apps).  
- Monitor costs and performance.  
- Manage users and security with **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**.  

---

## 🖥 3. Deploy Your First Web App

Azure makes it easy to host a simple app:  

1. In the Portal, click **Create a Resource**.  
2. Choose **App Service → Web App**.  
3. Select your runtime (ex: Java 17, Node.js, Python, .NET).  
4. Deploy your code from GitHub or upload directly.  

In a few minutes, Azure will generate a **public URL** → your app is live! 🎉

## 🔐 4. Keep Security in Mind

Even in your first projects, think security:  
- Always use **HTTPS**.  
- Store secrets (like API keys) in **Azure Key Vault**.  
- Use **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** to manage permissions.  

---

## 📊 5. Monitor and Scale

Go to **Azure Monitor** to check logs, metrics, and alerts.  
If your app gets more traffic, you can scale in one click:  
- **Vertical scaling**: increase CPU/RAM.  
- **Horizontal scaling**: add more instances.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

That’s it! In just a few steps, you’ve created your first app on Azure. From here, you can explore databases (Azure SQL, Cosmos DB), containers (AKS), or serverless functions (Azure Functions).  

Cloud can seem overwhelming, but with Azure’s guided interface and free credits, you’ll quickly build confidence.
