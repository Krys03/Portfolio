# 🔐 Understanding IAM, OAuth2, and JWT: Simple Security Basics

Security is at the heart of every modern application. Whether you’re building a website, a mobile app, or a cloud service, you need a way to control **who has access** and **what they can do**. That’s where **IAM, OAuth2, and JWT** come in.  

This article explains these concepts in **simple terms**, so you can understand how they fit together.

## 👤 What is IAM (Identity & Access Management)?

**IAM** is about managing **users, identities, and permissions**.  
With IAM, you can:  
- Create users and groups.  
- Assign roles and access levels (e.g., admin vs. reader).  
- Enforce policies (e.g., who can delete data, who can only view).  

Think of IAM as the **digital security guard** of your system.

## 🔑 OAuth2: The Standard for Authorization

OAuth2 is a protocol that lets users grant access **without sharing their password**.  

Example:  
- You log in to an app using **“Sign in with Google”**.  
- The app never sees your Google password.  
- Instead, Google gives the app a **token** saying you’re allowed to enter.  

This keeps your credentials safe while still allowing secure connections between apps.

## 🪙 JWT (JSON Web Token): The Token Format

A **JWT** is the small, encoded file often used in OAuth2 to prove your identity.  
It contains:  
- **Header**: type of token + algorithm.  
- **Payload**: user info + permissions.  
- **Signature**: verifies the token hasn’t been changed.  

✅ Example JWT (simplified):  
```json
{
  "user": "chris",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1696192000
}
